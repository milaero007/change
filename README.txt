You should implement function giveChangeImpl called within giveChange  which computes a change
to give to the customer with 10, 5, 2 and 1 dollar notes.
1 Dollar is authorized only for 1 and 3 dollar change. For all others only 
The goal is to give to the customer as little as possible notes. 
For Exemple if the change is 6, the good answer is 3(2$), for 7: 1(5$) + 1(2$), 8: 4(2$), etc.
